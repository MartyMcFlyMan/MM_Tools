# MM Tools!
I'm doing a complete rework of the tools so the old ones are not available anymore.

Now contains the brand new MM_Rename tool!
Just download the code and unzip the archive, then paste the MM_Rename folder in:

<pre>C:\Users\[username]\Documents\maya\[version]\scripts</pre>

To install: 
Drag and drop MM_Rename.py in the maya viewport.
